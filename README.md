# Astar-Pathfinding-Visualizer
Visual display of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm

When you start the program you'll be presented with a blank game board. 
The first left click will be your start point and the second left click will represent your end point. 
Once you have declared your start and end point you can place barriers by left clicking and dragging all around the board. 
When you are satisified with your barriers and end points you can press the spacebar to see how the algorithm finds its path from Point A to Point B.
When you're done you can press C to clear the board and start again.
